1. Dependencies: These files will likely share dependencies on several Python libraries such as Flask for web application development, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and requests for making HTTP requests to patent databases.

2. Exported Variables: Variables like "app" (the Flask application instance) and "db" (the database instance) will be shared across several files like "app.py", "views.py", "models.py", and "forms.py".

3. Data Schemas: The "models.py" file will define the data schemas for the application, which will be used in "views.py", "app.py", and "forms.py". This might include schemas for User, Patent, and CostEstimate.

4. DOM Element IDs: The JavaScript file "main.js" will interact with several DOM elements from the HTML templates. These might include IDs like "searchForm", "resultsTable", "costEstimate", and "errorMessage".

5. Message Names: The Flask application will use flash messages to communicate with the user. These messages will be defined in "views.py" and used in the HTML templates. Examples might include "searchSuccess", "searchFailure", "estimateSuccess", and "estimateFailure".

6. Function Names: Several functions will be shared across the Python files. For example, "patent_search.py" might define a function "search_patent" that is used in "views.py". Similarly, "cost_estimator.py" might define a function "estimate_cost" that is also used in "views.py".

7. Configurations: The "config.py" file will contain configurations that are used across the application, such as database URI, secret key, and third-party API keys.

8. Test Cases: The test files will share the same function names with the files they are testing. For example, "test_patent_search.py" will test the "search_patent" function from "patent_search.py".
